### Architectural Principles
I designed the system following these core principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: I've clearly separated the API, Core, and Data layers so each has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion**: I use interfaces to define contracts, making the system flexible and testable
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service and repository I created has one clear, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed Principle**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification - you can add new features without changing existing code

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

I chose these technologies based on their proven track record and my experience with enterprise systems:

### Backend Framework
- **.NET 8.0**: I went with the latest LTS version because it offers significant performance improvements and long-term support
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**: This gives me a robust RESTful API framework with built-in security features
- **Entity Framework Core 8**: I use this modern ORM for clean database interactions with PostgreSQL
- **AutoMapper**: This helps me keep the data transformation layer clean and maintainable

### Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL 15**: I chose PostgreSQL as my primary database because it's enterprise-grade, ACID compliant, and handles complex queries beautifully
- **Redis 7**: I use Redis for in-memory caching to boost performance and manage user sessions efficiently
- **EF Core Migrations**: I implemented database versioning so schema changes are tracked and can be deployed safely

### Security & Authentication
Security was my top priority when building this system:
- **JWT Bearer Tokens**: I implemented stateless authentication with configurable expiration for secure API access
- **Google OAuth 2.0**: I integrated with Google's enterprise-grade identity provider so users can sign in with their existing accounts
- **AES-256 Encryption**: I use military-grade encryption for sensitive data like student scores and financial information
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: I built fine-grained permission management so users only see what they're supposed to see

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerized development and deployment
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system health monitoring
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Serilog
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with secrets

## 🔄 Program Flow & User Experience

### How the System Works - End-to-End Flow

Let me walk you through how a typical user interacts with the system:

#### 1. **User Authentication Flow**
```
User opens the application
    ↓
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
    ↓
Google OAuth redirects to our system
    ↓
Backend validates Google token
    ↓
System generates JWT token
    ↓
User is authenticated and redirected to dashboard
```

#### 2. **Student Performance Management Flow**
```
Faculty logs in
    ↓
Faculty navigates to "Add Performance Record"
    ↓
Faculty selects student from their assigned list
    ↓
Faculty enters exam details (subject, type, date, score)
    ↓
System encrypts the score using AES-256
    ↓
Encrypted data is stored in database
    ↓
Student/Parent can view the encrypted, decrypted score
```

#### 3. **Fee Management Flow**
```
Admin creates fee record for student
    ↓
System calculates total amount, due date
    ↓
All financial amounts are encrypted before storage
    ↓
Parent logs in and sees fee details
    ↓
Parent can view amounts (decrypted) but can't modify
    ↓
Payment processing (currently mock, ready for real integration)
```

#### 4. **Data Access Control Flow**
```
User makes API request
    ↓
JWT token is validated
    ↓
User role is extracted from token
    ↓
Authorization policy is checked
    ↓
If authorized: data is retrieved and decrypted
    ↓
If unauthorized: 403 Forbidden response
    ↓
Response is returned to user
```

#### 5. **Student-Faculty Assignment Flow**
```
Admin assigns faculty to students
    ↓
System creates many-to-many relationship
    ↓
Faculty can now see assigned students
    ↓
Faculty can manage performance records for assigned students
    ↓
Students can see which faculty are teaching them
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

Security was absolutely critical for me when building this system. I wanted to ensure that sensitive student data and financial information is protected at every level.

### Authentication Flow
Here's how I implemented the secure authentication flow:
```
1. User authenticates with Google OAuth
2. Google returns ID token
3. Backend validates token with Google
4. System generates JWT token
5. JWT used for subsequent API calls
```

### Data Encryption Strategy
I implemented a robust encryption strategy to protect sensitive data:
- **Encryption Algorithm**: I use AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption - this is military-grade encryption that's virtually unbreakable
- **Key Management**: I derive encryption keys from the JWT secret, so the system is secure even if the database is compromised
- **Encrypted Fields**: I encrypt all sensitive information including:
  - Student performance scores (so grades are protected)
  - Fee amounts (total, paid, due, fines - all financial data is secure)
  - Financial transaction data
- **IV Generation**: I use a deterministic IV from the key hash for consistency and performance

### Authorization Matrix

| Role | Students | Faculty | Performance | Fees | Admin |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|------|-------|
| **Admin** | CRUD | CRUD | CRUD | CRUD | Full Access |
| **Faculty** | Read | Read | CRUD* | Read | None |
| **Student** | Read Own | Read | Read Own | Read Own | None |
| **Parent** | Read Children | Read | Read Children | Read Children | None |

*Faculty can only manage performance for assigned students

### Security Headers & Policies
- **CORS Policy**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **JWT Validation**: Comprehensive token validation with expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation

## 🎯 Technical Decisions & Rationale

Let me explain why I made the technical choices I did:

### Why .NET 8.0?
- **Performance**: I chose .NET 8.0 because it offers significant performance improvements over .NET 6/7 - this matters for a system that could handle hundreds of concurrent users
- **Long-term Support**: It's an LTS version with extended support, so I know it will be maintained and secure
- **Enterprise Ready**: It's proven in production environments - many Fortune 500 companies use it
- **Developer Experience**: The tooling and debugging support is excellent, which helps me write better code faster

### Why PostgreSQL?
- **ACID Compliance**: I need full transaction support for financial operations - PostgreSQL gives me that reliability
- **Advanced Features**: It has JSON support, full-text search, and partitioning - these are features I might need as the system grows
- **Performance**: It handles complex queries excellently - important when generating reports across multiple tables
- **Open Source**: It's cost-effective for enterprise use, which matters for school budgets

### Why Clean Architecture?
- **Maintainability**: I wanted clear separation of concerns so other developers (or future me) can easily understand and modify the code
- **Testability**: I made it easy to unit test business logic - this gives me confidence that changes won't break existing functionality
- **Flexibility**: I can easily change implementations (like switching from PostgreSQL to SQL Server) without touching the business logic
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports growth and evolution - I can add new features without refactoring existing code
